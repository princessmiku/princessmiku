<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Miku</h1>
<h3 align="center">A python developer from Germany</h3>
<p>I have been programming for a while, I started around May 2017. First with Java and shortly after with Python. Since then Python is my favorite language, which I use for almost all my projects.
I estimate my knowledge to be advanced already, even if I keep learning new things.

My native language is German, in English I am unfortunately quite bad, so I often have to rely on a translator.
Did you know? Deepl.com is a great translator!

Programming was and still is just a hobby for me. Because I currently have to do other things and learn, I can not always put so much time into my projects :( but I always do my best to be active, even if the project must rest 1-2 months.
